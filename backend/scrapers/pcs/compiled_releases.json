For more information see: http://www.publiccontractsscotland.gov.uk/info/InfoCentre.aspx?ID=2361\r\n A summary of the expected community benefits has been provided as follows:\r\n The Public Sector in Scotland is committed to the delivery of high quality public services, and recognises that this is critically dependent on a workforce that is well-rewarded, well-motivated, well-led, has access to appropriate opportunities for training and skills development, diverse and engaged in decision making. These factors are also important for workforce recruitment and retention, and thus continuity of service.\r\n Public Bodies in Scotland are adopting fair work practices, which include:\r\n - a fair and equal pay policy that includes a commitment to supporting the living wage, including, for example being a living wage accredited employer;\r\n - clear managerial responsibility to nurture talent and help individuals fulfil their potential, including for example, a strong commitment to modern apprenticeships and the development of Scotland's young workforce;\r\n - promoting equality of opportunity and developing a workforce which reflects the population of Scotland in terms of characteristics such as age, gender, religion or belief, race, sexual orientation and disability;\r\n - support for learning and development;\r\n - stability of employment and hours of work, and avoiding exploitative employment practices, including for example no inappropriate use of zero-hours contracts;\r\n - flexible working (including for example practices such as flexi-time and career breaks) and support for family friendly working and wider work life balance;\r\n - support progressive workforce engagement, for example Trade Union recognition and representation where possible, otherwise alternative arrangements to give staff an effective voice.\r\n In order to ensure the highest standards of service quality in this contract we expect contractors to take a similarly positive approach to fair work practices as part of a fair and equitable employment and reward package.\r\n (SC Ref:659911)"}

These factors are also important for workforce recruitment and retention, and thus continuity of service.\r\n Public Bodies in Scotland are adopting fair work practices, which include:\r\n â a fair and equal pay policy that includes a commitment to supporting the living wage, including, for example being a living wage\r\n accredited employer;\r\n â clear managerial responsibility to nurture talent and help individuals fulfil their potential, including for example, a strong commitment\r\n to modern apprenticeships and the development of Scotland's young workforce;\r\n â promoting equality of opportunity and developing a workforce which reflects the population of Scotland in terms of characteristics such\r\n as age, gender, religion or belief, race, sexual orientation and disability;\r\n â support for learning and development;\r\n â stability of employment and hours of work, and avoiding exploitative employment practices, including for example no inappropriate use\r\n of zero-hours contracts;\r\n â flexible working (including for example practices such as flexi-time and career breaks) and support for family friendly working and\r\n wider work life balance;\r\n â support progressive workforce engagement, for example Trade Union recognition and representation where possible, otherwise\r\n alternative arrangements to give staff an effective voice.\r\n In order to ensure the highest standards of service quality in this contract we expect contractors to take a similarly positive approach to fair work practices as part of a fair and equitable employment and reward package.\r\n Bidders who are invited to submit an initial bid will need to describe how they will commit to fair work practices for workers (including any agency or subcontractor workers) engaged in the delivery of this contract.\r\n The buyer is using PCS-Tender to conduct this ITT exercise.
